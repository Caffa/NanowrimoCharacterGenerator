## Summary
Today I wrote a basic character generator 
- At first, it was all in one file
- Later, separated general data (to pick from) and the character generator (picker)
- Improved on the Json
- Used a python script to process an excel into json

## Current Versions
- Better Character Generator
- Better Generator
- Word Processing (misc scripts)
- Resources (here are all the data - I changed a bit of it - from github for my random data needs)

## Status CheckIn
Total time spent: 6 hours?
Current Status: All working
Character Generator generates:
- Name (first, mid, last) according to family (kinda class) & gender
- Gender
- Greeting (basic, for show)
